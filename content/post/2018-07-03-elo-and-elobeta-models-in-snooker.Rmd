# Prologue

For many years I've been following snooker as a sport. It has it all: hypnotic beauty of smart play, elegance of cue strikes and psychological tension of competition. The one thing I don't like that much is its _ranking system_.

Generally speaking, __current snooker ranking is based on player accomplishments in tournaments (events)__ with different "weights" for different tournaments. Long time ago, it just used World Championships. Then, after more events had emerged, there was a table of points player could earn for winning at certain stage of tournament. Now it has the form of "rolling" sum of prize money player won during (roughly) past two calendar years.

This system has two main advantages: it is __simple__ (win more money -> rise in rankings) and __predictabile__ (want to get certain ranking -> win certain amount of money, other things being equal). The problem is that __this type of rankings doesn't account the strength (skill, form) of player's opponents__. The usual counter-argument for this is that if player reached high stage of tournament then he/she is "strong" at this moment of time ("weak players don't win tournaments"). Well, it does sound quite convincing. However, in snooker, as in any sport, the role of chance should be taken into account: if player is "weaker" it doesn't mean that he can't ever win in a match with "stronger" player. It means that this happens less often then the other way around. Here where [Elo model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) comes into play.

The idea behind Elo model is that each player is associated with numerical rating. The assumption is that a result of a game between two players can be predicted based on difference of their ratings: more value indicates more probability of "stronger" (with higher rating) player to win. __Elo ranking is based on current player "strength"__ derived by wins against other players. This eliminates main disadvantage of current official ranking system. It is also capable of updating player rating during tournament to numerically react to player's strong tournament performance.

Having some practical experience with Elo ratings, I think it can do well in snooker too. However, there is one obstacle: _it is devised for competitions with uniform type of games_. Yes, there are some variations to account for [home field advantage](https://medium.com/@mattbarger/soccer-elo-the-rebuild-df6b58bd8b94) in football or [first move advantage](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.4571.pdf) in chess (both by adding fixed amount of rating points to "less advantageous" player). In snooker, however, matches are played in the "best of $N$" format: the first one to win $n = \frac{N + 1}{2}$ frames wins a match. We will also call this format "$n$ to win".

Intuitively, winning a "10 to win" match (final of major tournament) should be harder for "weaker" player then "4 to win" match (first rounds of current Home Nations tournaments). This is taken into account by my proposed __EloBeta model__.

To celebrate actual start of 2018/19 snooker season I decided to write this post in which __I explore adequacy of both Elo and EloBeta models on snooker match results__. Note that the goal is not to build models for forecasting and gambling purposes but for assessing players "strength" and creating "fair" ranking.

The idea of using Elo rating in snooker is not new at all. There are works on this topic, for example:

- [Snooker Analyst](http://www.snookeranalyst.com/current-ratings/rating-summary/) provides "Elo inspired" (more like [Bradleyâ€“Terry model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley-Terry_model)) rating system based on the idea of updating rating based on difference between "actual frames won" and "expected frames won". This approach is a little bit questionable. Surely, more frame difference should indicate more difference in strength, however, achieving that is not player's goal. In snooker aim is "just" to win match, i.e. get certain amount of frame wins before the opponent.
- [This forum discussion](https://www.snookerisland.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=59&t=5585) with implementation of basic Elo model.
- Possibly, there are other works that I've missed. I will highly appreciate any information on this topic.

# Overview

This post is intended for both R users interested in Elo ratings and snooker analysts and fans. All experiments are written with intention to be reproducible. All code is hidden under spoilers (text appears after clicking on its summary, usually beginning with "Code for ..."). It has commentaries and uses [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages, so it might be an interesting read for R users and programmers.

This post is organized as follows:

- __Models__ describes _Elo_ and _EloBeta_ models with their R implementations.
- __Experiment__ describes details and intentions of computations: which _data_ and _methodology_ were used (and why) and what are the _results_.
- __Exploration of EloBeta ratings__ has application results of EloBeta model to actual snooker data. This section is written more for Snooker fans than for R enthusiasts.

We will need the following setup:

`r blogdown::shortcode("spoiler_details", summary = '\"Code for setup\"')`

```{r library}
# Data wrangling packages
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
# Visualization package
library(ggplot2)
# Package for ratings
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(comperank))

theme_set(theme_bw())

# Shouldn't be needed. Added just in case.
set.seed(20180703)
```

`r blogdown::shortcode("/spoiler_details")`

# Models

Both models are based on the following assumptions:

1. There is a fixed set of players which should be ranked from "strongest" (first place) to "weakest" (last place).
1. Ranking is done by associating player $i$ with numerical rating $r_i$: a number indicating the "strength" of player (more value -> "stronger").
1. The more difference in player ratings before the match the less favorable is "weaker" player to win it.
1. Ratings are updated after every match based on its result and the ratings before it.
1. Winning against "stronger" opponent should lead to bigger increase in rating than winning against "weaker" opponent. The opposite should be true for losing.

## Elo

`r blogdown::shortcode("spoiler_details", summary = '\"Code for Elo model\"')`

```{r elo-model}
#' @details This function is vectorized by all its arguments. Also usage of
#' `...` is crucial to allow supplying unrelated arguments in the future.
#' 
#' @return A probability of player 1 (rating `rating1`) wins in a match with
#'   player 2 (rating `rating2`). Here difference in ratings directly affects
#'   the outcome.
elo_win_prob <- function(rating1, rating2, ksi = 400, ...) {
  norm_rating_diff <- (rating2 - rating1) / ksi
  
  1 / (1 + 10^norm_rating_diff)
}

#' @return A rating function for Elo model that can be supplied to
#'   `comperank::add_iterative_ratings()`.
elo_fun_gen <- function(K, ksi = 400) {
  function(rating1, score1, rating2, score2) {
    comperank::elo(rating1, score1, rating2, score2, K = K, ksi = ksi)[1, ]
  }
}
```

`r blogdown::shortcode("/spoiler_details")`

Elo model updates ratings by the following steps:

- __Compute probability__ (_before_ the match) __of certain player to win the match__. Probability of one player (we will call him/her "first") with "identifier" $i$ and rating $r_i$ winning against the other player ("second") with "identifier" $j$ and rating $r_j$ is equal to

    $$Pr(r_i , r_j) = \frac{1}{1 + 10^{(r_j - r_i)/400}}$$

    This way of computing probability is aligned with third model assumption.
    
    Difference normalization by 400 is a mathematical way to say which difference is considered "big". This can be replaced by a model parameter $\xi$, however this only affects the spread of future ratings and is often an overkill. Number 400 is fairly standard in chess world.
    
    In general approach probability is equal to $L(r_j - r_i)$ where $L(x)$ is some strictly increasing function with values from 0 to 1. We will use logistic curve to compute winning probability. More thorough study can be found in [this article](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/Papers/me-Elo-SS.pdf).

- __Obtain match result__ $S$. In basic model it is 1 if first player wins (second player loses), 0.5 in case of draw and 0 if second player wins.
- __Update ratings__:
    - $\delta = K \cdot (S - Pr(r_i , r_j))$. This is the value by which ratings will change. It introduces the "K factor" (only model parameter). Less $K$ (ratings being equal) means less change in ratings - model is more conservative, i.e. more wins is needed to "prove" increase in "strength". On the other hand, more $K$ means more "trust" to the current results than current ratings. _Choosing "optimal" $K$ is a way to produce "good" ranking system_.
    - $r_i^{(new)} = r_i + \delta$, $r_j^{(new)} = r_j - \delta$.

__Notes__:

- As one can see from rating update formulas, the sum of ratings for all ranked players doesn't change over time: rating increase of one rating can be only done by taking this amount from another player.
- Players without any matches played are associated with initial rating 0. The usual value is 1500, however I don't see any other reason except psychological for this. With previous note, using 0 means that sum of all ratings will always be 0, which is kind of beautiful.
- It is needed some matches to be played in order for rating to represent player's "strength". This introduces a problem: newly added players start with rating 0 which is almost surely not the lowest among current players. In other words, newcomers are considered to be "stronger" than some other players. This should be dealt with by external procedures of rating updates when introducing new player: maybe he/she should start with some low rating while compensating overall sum decrease by uniform increasing of other players' ratings.
- Why this procedure makes sense? In case of equal ratings $\delta$ always equals $0.5 \cdot K$. Let's say, for example, that $r_i = 0$ and $r_j = 400$. It means that probability of first player winning is $\frac{1}{1 + 10} \approx 0.0909$, i.e. he/she will win 1 out of 11 matches.
    - In case of win, he/she will be awarded with approximately $0.909 \cdot K$ increase, which is more than in case of equal ratings.
    - If he/she is defeated, then rating is decreased by approximately $0.0909 \cdot K$, which is less than in case of equal ratings.
    
    This shows that Elo model is aligned with fifth model assumption: winning against "stronger" opponent leads to bigger increase in rating than winning against "weaker" opponent and vice versa.

Of course, Elo model has its (fairly high-level) [practical issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system#Practical_issues). However, the most important for our research is that "it thinks" that all matches are played in uniform conditions. It means, that match length isn't taken into account: winning in "4 to win" match is rewarded the same as winning in "10 to win" match. That is where EloBeta comes into play.

## EloBeta

`r blogdown::shortcode("spoiler_details", summary = '\"Code for EloBeta model\"')`

```{r elobeta-model}
#' @details This function is vectorized by all its arguments.
#' 
#' @return A probability of player 1 (rating `rating1`) wins in a match with
#'   player 2 (rating `rating2`). Match is played until either player wins
#'   `frames_to_win` frames. Here difference in ratings directly affects
#'   the probability of winning one frame.
elobeta_win_prob <- function(rating1, rating2, frames_to_win, ksi = 400, ...) {
  prob_frame <- elo_win_prob(rating1 = rating1, rating2 = rating2, ksi = ksi)
  
  # Probability that first player wins `frames_to_win` frames sooner than second
    # player based on probability of first player to win one frame `prob_frame`.
    # Frames are treated as independent games.
  pbeta(prob_frame, frames_to_win, frames_to_win)
}

#' @return Match result in terms of player 1 win: 1 if he/she wins, 0.5 in case
#'   of a draw, and 0 if he/she loses.
get_match_result <- function(score1, score2) {
  # There are no ties in snooker but this handles general case
  near_score <- dplyr::near(score1, score2)
  
  dplyr::if_else(near_score, 0.5, as.numeric(score1 > score2))
}

#' @return A rating function for EloBeta model that can be supplied to
#'   `comperank::add_iterative_ratings()`.
elobeta_fun_gen <- function(K, ksi = 400) {
  function(rating1, score1, rating2, score2) {
    prob_win <- elobeta_win_prob(
      rating1 = rating1, rating2 = rating2,
      frames_to_win = pmax(score1, score2), ksi = ksi
    )
    
    match_result <- get_match_result(score1, score2)
    delta <- K * (match_result - prob_win)
    
    c(rating1 + delta, rating2 - delta)
  }
}
```

`r blogdown::shortcode("/spoiler_details")`

In Elo model difference in ratings directly affects the outcome probability of winning the whole match. The main idea behind EloBeta model is to __make difference in ratings directly affect the outcome of one frame__ and __actually compute the probability of a player winning $n$ frames before his opponent__.

The question is: how to compute this probability? Turns out, this is one of the oldest task in the history of probability theory and has its own name - [Problem of points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_points). Very nice description can be found in [this post](https://probabilityandstats.wordpress.com/2016/11/06/the-problem-of-points/). Using its notation, the outcome probability equals to:

$$
P(n, n) = \sum\limits_{j = n}^{2n-1}{{{2n-1} \choose {j}} p^j (1-p)^{2n-1-j}}
$$

Here $P(n, n)$ is a probability of first player to win in "$n$ to win" match; $p$ is his/her probability to win one frame ($1-p$ - opponents probability). With this approach one assumes that __result of frames inside a match is independent one from another__. This is arguable, but necessary assumption (in terms of this model).

Is there a way to compute this faster? It turns out, that the answer is yes. After hours of formula wrangling, practical experiments and internet search I found the following [property](https://dlmf.nist.gov/8.17#E5) of [regularized incomplete beta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_function#Incomplete_beta_function) $I_x(a, b)$. By substituting $m = k,~ n = 2k - 1$ into that property and changing $k$ into $n$ we obtain that $P(n, n) = I_p(n, n)$.

This is also very good news for R users, because $I_p(n, n)$ can be computed as simply as `pbeta(p, n, n)`. __Note__ that the general case probability of winning $n$ frames before opponent wins $m$ can also be computed as $I_p(n, m)$ and `pbeta(p, n, m)` respectively. This introduces the reach field of _updating winning probabilities during the mach_.

So the procedure of updating ratings within EloBeta model is as follows (given ratings $r_i, r_j$, number of frames $n$ to win in match and match outcome $S$, as in Elo model):

- __Compute probability of first player to win the frame__: $p = Pr(r_i , r_j) = \frac{1}{1 + 10^{(r_j - r_i)/400}}$.
- __Compute probability of this player to win the match__: $Pr^{Beta}(r_i, r_j) = I_p(n, n)$. For example, if $p$ equals 0.4 then probability to win "4 to win" match drops to `r round(pbeta(0.4, 4, 4), 2)` and with "18 to win" to `r round(pbeta(0.4, 18, 18), 2)`.
- __Update ratings__:
    - $\delta = K \cdot (S - Pr^{Beta}(r_i , r_j))$.
    - $r_i^{(new)} = r_i + \delta$, $r_j^{(new)} = r_j - \delta$.

__Note__ that, as difference in ratings affects probability of winning one frame (not the whole match), we should expect lower optimal $K$: part of $\delta$'s value comes from amplifying effect of $Pr^{Beta}(r_i, r_j)$.

The idea of computation match result based on probability of winning one frame is not very novel. On [this site](https://wismuth.com/elo/calculator.html), authored by FranÃ§ois Labelle, you can find online computation of probability of winning a "best of $N$" match (with some other functionality). I was very glad to notice that results of our computations match. However, I didn't find any sources of incorporating this into Elo updating procedure. I will highly appreciate any information on this topic.

I've only managed to found [this post](http://freerangestats.info/blog/2015/08/07/fibs-elo-ratings-basics) and [this description](http://www.bkgm.com/articles/McCool/ratings.html) of Elo system on backgammon internet server (FIBS). Here different matches are handled by multiplying rating difference by square root of match length. However, there seems to be no strong theoretical reason for this.

# Experiment

The experiment has several goals. Based on snooker data:

- Derive best value of "K factor" for both models.
- Study stability of models in terms of prediction probability accuracy.
- Study the effect of using "invitational" events on ratings.
- Produce "best" rating history of all professional players from 2017/18 season.

## Data

`r blogdown::shortcode("spoiler_details", summary = '\"Code for data creation\"')`

```{r experiment-data}
# Function to split cases between "train", "validation", and "test" types
split_cases <- function(n, props = c(0.5, 0.25, 0.25)) {
  breaks <- n * cumsum(head(props, -1)) / sum(props)
  id_vec <- findInterval(seq_len(n), breaks, left.open = TRUE) + 1
  
  c("train", "validation", "test")[id_vec]
}

pro_players <- snooker_players %>% filter(status == "pro")

# Matches only between pro players.
pro_matches_all <- snooker_matches %>%
  # Using actually happened matches
  filter(!walkover1, !walkover2) %>%
  # Filter matches only between pro players
  semi_join(y = pro_players, by = c(player1Id = "id")) %>%
  semi_join(y = pro_players, by = c(player2Id = "id")) %>%
  # Add 'season' column

    y = snooker_events %>% select(id, season), by = c(eventId = "id")
  ) %>%

    game = seq_len(n()),
    player1 = player1Id, score1, player2 = player2Id, score2,
    matchId = id, endDate, eventId, season,
    # Compute match type ("train", "validation", or "test") with 50/25/25 split
    matchType = split_cases(n())
  ) %>%
  # Convert to widecr format
  as_widecr()

# Matches only between pro players in not invitational events (which by
  # quantity is dominated by Championship League).
pro_matches_off <- pro_matches_all %>%
  anti_join(
    y = snooker_events %>% filter(type == "Invitational"),
    by = c(eventId = "id")
  )

# Split confirmation
get_split <- . %>% count(matchType) %>% mutate(share = n / sum(n))

# This should give 50/25/25 split (train/validation/test).
pro_matches_all %>% get_split()

# This gives different split because invitational events aren't spread evenly
  # during season. However, this way matches are split based on the same
  # __time__ breaks as in `pro_matches_all`. This ensures that matches with same
  # type represent identical __time periods__.
pro_matches_off %>% get_split()

# Grid for K factor
k_grid <- 1:100
```

We will use snooker data from [comperank](https://echasnovski.github.io/comperank/reference/index.html#section-snooker-data) package. The original source is [snooker.org](http://www.snooker.org/) site. Results are taken from the following matches:

- Match is __from 2016/17 or 2017/18 seasons__.
- Match is a __part of "professional" snooker event__. That is:
    - It has "Invitational", "Qualifying", or "Ranking" type. We will also differ two sets of matches: "all matches" (from all these events) and "official matches" (not from invitational events). There are two main reasons behind it:
        - In invitational events not all players are given opportunity to change their ratings (which isn't a clearly bad thing under Elo and EloBeta models).
        - Belief that players "take seriously" only official ranking events. __Note__ that most of "Invitational" events are from "Championship League" which, I think, are treated by most players as practice with opportunity to win money, i.e. "not very seriously". Their presence can affect outcome ratings.
        
        Besides "Championship League", other invitational events are: "2016 China Championship", both "Champion of Champions", both "Masters", "2017 Hong Kong Masters", "2017 World games", "2017 Romanian Masters".
    - It describes traditional snooker (not 6 Red or Power Snooker) between individual players (not teams).
    - Both genders can take part (not only men or women).
    - Players of all ages can take part (not only seniors or under 21).
    - It is not "Shoot-Out" as those events are treated differently in snooker.org database.
- Match __actually happened__: its result is due to actual play from both players.
- Match __is between two professionals__ (pros). List of professionals is taken as for 2017/18 season (`r tot_n_players` players). This seems like the most controversial decision, as removing "pro-ama" ("ama" for "amateur") and "ama-ama" matches leads to "closing eyes" on pros' losses to amateurs, and thus giving unfair advantage to those pros. I think this choice is necessary to ensure absence of [rating inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system#Ratings_inflation_and_deflation) which will happen if matches with amateurs are taken into account. Another possibility would be to study pros and amas together, but this seems unreasonable to me within this research. Professional's loss to amateur is treated as loss of opportunity to increase rating.

The final numbers of used matches are `r nrow(pro_matches_all)` for "all matches" and `r nrow(pro_matches_off)` for "official matches" (`r all_matches_per_player` and `r off_matches_per_player` matches per player respectively).

To find "optimal" value of $K$ we will use the even grid $K = 1, 2, ..., 100$. Accounting for greater values seems to be unreasonable which is confirmed by the experiment. The following procedure is used to find it:

- For every $K$:
    - __Compute history of iterative ratings__ of certain model based on certain data set. It means that ratings of players would be known before every match. This is done with [add_iterative_ratings()](https://echasnovski.github.io/comperank/reference/iterative.html) function from `comperank` package. This procedure corresponds to "live ratings" which update after every match.
    - Based on data, starting from a certain (distant from the beginning) moment in time, __compute goodness of model fit__. We will use [RMSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation) between probability of first player to win (computed based on model) and match result. That is $RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{|T|} \sum\limits_{t \in T}{(S_t - P_t)^2}}$, where $T$ - indices of used matches, $|T|$ - number of used matches, $S_t$ - result of match for first player, $P_t$ - probability of first player to win the match (computed based on model). Not including matches from the beginning of data is needed for ratings to "catch up" to "current strength" from initial ratings.
- The value of $K$ with __stable minimal RMSE__ is said to be optimal. Here by "stable" we mean that small RMSE values is present in some neighborhood of optimal $K$ (will be controlled not very strictly by looking at graphs). Values of RMSE lower 0.5 (value for "model" with constant 0.5 probability) will be considered a success.

As one of the goals is to study stability of models, data will be split into three subsets: "train", "validation" and "test". They are ordered in time, i.e. any "train"/"validation" match has ending time earlier than any "validation"/"test" match. I decided to do actual split in 50/25/25 proportion for "all matches". Split of "official matches" is done by removing from "all matches" invitational events. It gives split not totally in desired proportion, but rather `r off_split`. However, this approach ensures that matches with same type in both match data represent identical __time periods__.

Experiment will be performed for all combinations of the following variables:

- __Type of model__: Elo and EloBeta.
- __Type of match data__: "All matches" and "official matches".
- __Experiment type__: "Validation" ("validation" matches are used for computing RMSE after "warming up" on "train" matches) and "Test" ("test" matches are used after "warming up" on both "train" and "validation" ones).

From the experiment we can make the following conclusions:

- As it was expected, optimal $K$ values for EloBeta are lower than for Elo.
- Using official matches (without invitational events) gives more stable results ("Validation" and "Test" results differ less). This shouldn't be considered as a point that professionals take invitational events not seriously. Probably, this is due to quality of match results from "Championship League": it has rather unpredictable "3 to win" format and tight schedule.
- Change in RMSE for optimal $K$ is not substantial. That is, RMSE didn't change drastically after computing optimal $K$ in "Validation" and applying it in "Test" experiment. Moreover, on "official matches" it even decreased.
- All optimal K values from test experiment (with longer "warm up") are lower than from validation experiment. This may be _the result_ of longer "warm up" or _just a feature_ of particular data.
- Best goodness of Elo and EloBeta fits are almost the same. Both are stable and below 0.5. Data for "official matches" (as they demonstrate stable behavior) is presented below. As results don't differ that much, we will round optimal $K$ to a factor of 5: for Elo model it is 30 and for EloBeta - 10.

```{r model-performance, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
plot_data %>%
  compute_optimal_k() %>%
  filter(testType == "Test") %>%
  transmute(Group = groupName, `Optimal K` = k, RMSE = round(goodness, 3)) %>%
  knitr::kable() %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"),
    full_width = FALSE
  )
```

Based on these results, I am inclined to conclude that __Elo model with $K = 30$ and EloBeta model with $K = 10$ can be usefully applied to officially ranked snooker matches__. However, EloBeta model accounts for different "$n$ to win" matches, so it should be preferred over Elo.

# Exploration of EloBeta ratings

The following results are computed based on "official matches" with EloBeta model ($K = 10$). All possible conclusions shouldn't be viewed as personal to any player.

Some observations:

- Current official #1 Mark Selby is ranked 3 places lower in EloBeta. This might be a sign that current distribution of prize money doesn't quite reflect efforts needed to win them (on average).
- Most "underrated" players according to official ranking are Jack Lisowski (astonishing 13 place difference), Ryan Day and Yan Bingtao (both have 7 place difference).
- Stuart Bingham is ranked 5 positions higher by EloBeta probably because he didn't play for six month due to WPBSA ban. His EloBeta rating didn't change during this period but in official rating he lost points because of its "rolling" nature. This case demonstrates one important differences between two approaches: official system is good to account for "not playing" and EloBeta is good to account for "playing".
- Judd Trump and Neil Robertson are ranked the same under both methods.
- With EloBeta model Allister Carter (officially ranked #11), Anthony McGill (#14) and Luca Brecel (#15) are not in top 16. Instead, Jack Lisowski (#26), Yan Bingtao (#23) and Stephen Maguire (#17) are in.

Here is an __example of predictions Based on EloBeta model__. The probability of 16-th player (`r last_top16_player$playerName[1]`) win one frame in a match against first player (`r first_top16_player$playerName[1]`) equals to `r example_prob(1)`. In "4 to win" match it drops to `r example_prob(4)`, in "10 to win" - `r example_prob(10)` and in World Championship final "18 to win" - `r example_prob(18)`. In my opinion, these numbers might be close to reality.

# Conclusions

- Solving "Problem of points" in R is as easy as `pbeta(p, n, m)`.
- EloBeta model is a modification of Elo for "best of $N$" (or "$n$ to win") matches. It can make predictions for different match length.
- Elo model with $K = 30$ and EloBeta model with $K = 10$ can be usefully applied to officially ranked snooker matches.
- Snooker related:
    - Most "underrated" players from EloBeta top 16 according to official ranking (as of end of 2017/18 season) are Jack Lisowski, Ryan Day and Yan Bingtao.
    - Season 2017/18 was very productive for Ronnie O'Sullivan, Mark J Williams and Jack Lisowski.
