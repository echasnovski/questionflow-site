<div id="prologue" class="section level1">
<h1>Prologue</h1>
<p>Not so long time ago I encountered the following task: given several groups of samples (one group - several samples from one distribution) make a visual presentation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)#Mode_of_a_sample">sample mode</a> variability in different groups (how sample mode changes between different samples). I decided to do this by animating these distributions with respect to their mode. The whole process can be summarised as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For every sample</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Count its values</strong>. Sample values are considered to a certain degree of precision, e.g. to the third digit, so talking about “counting values” has reasonable background.</li>
<li><strong>Divide counts by maximum count</strong>. The output is named “mode share distribution” (made up term, didn’t find any present one). For every unique value in sample the outcome is a number between 0 (value is totally absent) and 1 (value is a strict mode). Here value is considered to be “mode” if its “mode share” is above some threshold, say 0.9. For strict thresholds 1 is used.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For every set of group samples (first samples within groups, second samples, and so on) <strong>plot their “mode share distribution”</strong>. This is done by plotting several “mode share distributions” at once, in non-overlapping <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/index.html">ridgeline-like</a> fashion.</li>
<li><strong>Animate between plots</strong>. This simultaneously shows a mode variability in different groups. As just changing pictures didn’t seem like a challenge, I decided to make smooth transitions between plots. Packages <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tweenr/tweenr.pdf">tweenr</a> (CRAN version) and <a href="https://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate">gganimate</a> (original one by David Robinson, not a <a href="https://twitter.com/thomasp85/status/1004068316611260416">soon-to-be-revolutional one</a> by Thomas Lin Pedersen) provide core functionality for this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Methods I ended up using (some of them were discovered during solving this task) contain surprisingly many subtle <em>base R</em> and <em>tidyverse</em> tricks. This motivated me to write a post about my solution. It heavily uses core <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a> packages.</p>
<p>For educational purposes, I will slightly change the task: <strong>provided different probability distributions (by random generation R functions like <code>rnorm</code>), animate independent sample distributions to demonstrate mode variability</strong>.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The main point of this post is to provide a thorough code description with some highlighted tips and tricks. Considering this, the most information will be provided in code comments with some tricks described in text. I can see that provided solutions might be slightly overcomplicated but they seem to demonstrate stable behavior. <strong>Please note</strong> that this post, probably, won’t be that helpful for beginners in R, and some confident knowledge of R and tidyverse tools is needed.</p>
<p>Most of the code will be hidden under spoilers (text which appears after clicking on its summary, usually beginning with “Code for …”) to shrink initial post size, but I really encourage you to read them. However, only looking at plots and animations is, of course, completely fine :) They are considered to be a valuable by-product.</p>
<p>This post is organized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data generation</strong> describes the process of creating new samples from given random generators.</li>
<li><strong>Static plots</strong> describes the format of plotting data and a process of building a plot. There are also some example plots.</li>
<li><strong>Animation</strong> describes the logic behind transition between different plots and the process of creating animations. There are also some example animations.</li>
<li><strong>Bonus accidental art</strong> has an example of “accidental art” which was produced unintentionally but has an interesting look.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong> lists some lessons learned and some of my favorite tricks from this post.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will need the following setup:</p>

<h1>Data generation</h1>
{{% spoiler_details summary="Code for data generation" %}}
<pre class="r"><code># Generate data by sampling from different distributions

generate_data &lt;- function(r_fun_list, n_sample) {
  pmap_dfr(
    list(names(r_fun_list), r_fun_list, n_sample),
    # Interestingly, due to implementation of anonymous formula functions, you
      # can&#39;t use `..i` placeholders if they represent functions to be called.
    ~ tibble(distr = .x, value = .y(n = ..3))
  )
}</code></pre>
{{% /spoiler_details %}}
<p>Considering future parallel animation, I decided to organize data “per plot”. That is: one <a href="http://tibble.tidyverse.org/">tibble</a> contains information about one sample for every distribution and multiple samples should be stored in list. Function <code>generate_data()</code> creates one tibble, which in combination with <code>purrr::rerun()</code> can create a list of grouped samples. <strong>Note</strong> that, for reasonable results, numbers in <code>value</code> columns should be rounded.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sample_data &lt;- rerun(10, generate_data(r_funs, n_sample))

# One set of samples for examples
distr_data &lt;- sample_data[[1]] %&gt;% mutate(value = round(value, 2))
distr_data
## # A tibble: 3,000 x 2
##   distr value
##   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;

## 2 runif  0.51
## 3 runif  0.47
## 4 runif  0.47
## 5 runif  0.4 
## # ... with 2,995 more rows</code></pre>
<p>Tips and tricks:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><code>purrr::pmap_dfr()</code> helps create a data frame output after iterating in parallel over multiple vectors</em>. As all <code>purrr</code> mappers, function can be concisely described in formula fashion addressing arguments with <code>..1</code>, <code>..2</code> and so on. However, due to internal logic of <code>purrr</code>, using <code>..i</code> notation is impossible if it is meant as function to be applied. Fortunately, instead of <code>..1</code> one can use <code>.x</code> or <code>.</code> and instead of <code>..2</code> - <code>.y</code>, which works.</li>
</ul>

<div id="static-plots" class="section level1">
<h1>Static plots</h1>
<p>The general idea is to <strong>transform initial tibble into tibble with columns describing future plot</strong> which, essentially, will be <strong>sets (per distribution) of vertical segments</strong>. In this way, modifying pipeline from static plotting into smooth animation will be a matter of creating transitions between different plotting data (with use of <code>tweenr::tween_state()</code>) and animating them.</p>

<h2>Plotting data</h2>
{{% spoiler_details summary="Code for computing plotting data" %}}

<li><strong>yend</strong> &lt;dbl&gt; : The y coordinate of upper end of a segment.</li>
<li><strong>isMode</strong> &lt;lgl&gt; : Logical value indicating whether this segment represents mode value.</li>

<p>Function <code>make_static_plot()</code> expects plot data (as output of <code>get_plot_data()</code>) and title of the plot. It returns a ggplot object with many segments and zooming into (0, 1) in x-axis.</p>
<p>Tips and tricks:</p>
<ul>
<li>For effective code reuse while “ggplotting”, <em>one can create custom function <code>custom_fun()</code> which should return a list with results of <a href="http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a> constructor functions</em>. Usually, they are geoms but can be scales, theme elements and so on. This function can then be used as function layer with <code>ggplot(data) + custom_fun()</code>.</li>
<li><em>Value of <code>data</code> argument in layer function can be a function!</em> This one I discovered during solving this task and was pleasantly surprised by this functionality. A function will be applied to present data initialized in <code>ggplot()</code> call. It is very useful when one needs to plot object for one subset of data over the other. A handy way to create those functions are with <code>. %&gt;% ...</code> notation which creates a functional sequence (one of the features of <a href="http://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/pipe.html">magrittr pipe</a>). Here this trick is used to plot segments for mode values over the other segments.</li>

<p>The <code>tweenr</code> function for producing transition between states is <code>tween_states()</code>. Its core input is a list of data frames where all elements must contain the same number of rows. Every row describes parameters of the certain plotting object which will be transformed between present states.</p>
<p>As our states consist from essentially different objects, we will operate on pairs of consecutive states. It is our duty to match pairs of objects that will be transformed one into another. Basically, it means to <strong>say for every segment into/from which other segment it will transformed</strong>. Outline of proposed transition algorithm of <code>plot_data_from</code> into <code>plot_data_to</code> is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Match distribution types from both data sets</strong>. This is done with <code>full_join()</code> from <code>dplyr</code> in combination with <code>nest()</code> from <code>tidyr</code>. Using this type of join function is essential: it enables creating transition for pair of plot data with different sets of distributions (which is an overkill but a rather cool feature gained with little effort). If in pair plot data there is no matching distribution, the result will be <code>NULL</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Do matching between same distributions</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If any plot data is <code>NULL</code> (using <code>full_join()</code> should ensure that there is maximum one <code>NULL</code>) copy pair plotting data and modify column <strong>yend</strong> to equal <strong>y</strong>. This models “raising” segments “from the ground” of respective distribution.</li>
<li>If both plot data are not <code>NULL</code> match every “from-row” with the “to-row” by nearest <code>x</code> coordinate (represents sample value). To ensure that no segment “pops out of nowhere”, do similar process in reverse: for every “to-row” that wasn’t matched in previous step.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and tricks:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Index of the nearest reference point can be found by a slight modification of <code>findInterval()</code></em>. After computing <code>x_ind</code> with <code>findInterval(x, vec, all.inside = TRUE)</code> (here <code>vec</code> should be sorted increasingly), modify the result with <code>x_ind + (vec_sorted[x_ind + 1] - x &lt; x - vec_sorted[x_ind])</code>. This adds 1 (<code>TRUE</code> converted to numeric value) in case right end of interval is closer than left one.</li>
<li><em>Using <code>full_join()</code> can be very helpful in situation with different sets of groups</em>. It enables later repairing of unmatched data.</li>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes a rather simple task can lead to pretty complicated solutions (if one feels like accepting a challenge).</li>
<li>Visualization of mode variability for different distributions can be done by creating animation with transitions between independent sample distributions (highlighting modes).</li>
<li>Along the journey of solving small tasks, several tips and tricks were found:
<ul>
<li><code>purrr::pmap_dfr()</code> helps create a data frame output after iterating in parallel over multiple vectors. Shorthand formula notation for function should be used with caution when one of the input vectors contain functions to be applied.</li>
<li>While plotting several distributions organized vertically, one can compute the base y coordinate for them with <code>as.integer(as.factor(distr))</code> (<code>distr</code> being name of the distribution stored as character or factor).</li>
<li>For efficient “ggplotting” one can create custom function <code>custom_fun()</code> which should return a list with results of <code>ggplot2</code> constructor functions. It can then be used as function layer with <code>ggplot(data) + custom_fun()</code>.</li>
<li>Value of <code>data</code> argument in <code>ggplot2</code> layer function can itself be a function! It will be applied to present data initialized in <code>ggplot()</code> call. It is very useful when one needs to plot objects for one subset of data over the other. A handy way to create those functions are with <code>. %&gt;% ...</code> notation which creates a functional sequence (one of the features of <code>magrittr</code> pipe).</li>
<li>Index of the nearest reference point can be found by a slight modification of <code>findInterval()</code> (used with <code>all.inside = TRUE</code>) with adding 1 when right end of interval is closer than left one.</li>
<li>Using <code>full_join()</code> can be very helpful in situation with different sets of groups. It enables later repairing of unmatched data.</li>
<li>One can change resolution (for example, to 100 ppi) of output animation in <code>gganimate</code> by supplying <code>ani.dev = function(...) {png(res = 100, ...)}</code>.</li>
